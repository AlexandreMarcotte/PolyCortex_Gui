- improve the visual of the game
- Ability to have two player at the same time on the game
- Do other learning with scaled data or (unscale them for the predictor?)
- Ability to change the x axis len in the spectogram from the settings
    (so that you can focus on lets say only (0->100)
- Add axis
- Ability to turn on off the clean graph
- Clean MainEegDock to have EegDock in another class and to put the method
  that correspond to settings_dock inside its class
- Add axis to the spectogram
- Add moving display legend of the value of each line at there end (like in Charles application)
- Change the position of pinSettings to a specifi location on the top of the
    so that it doesnt change when I click on it and close it.
- I don't think it's normal that the Spectogram is 600 value long shouldn't it be
  only 125 like the fft from which it is derived? (look at it)
- Download the 3D head that I deleted when I was cleaning my computer
- Reject data if the time sleep in the frequency adjustement is really really
close to 0 (try to keep them to be saved in the file but reject them to be plotted and
to be filter)


TODO: NEW
- Filter by chunk (to do so set a number of value acquired in the signalcollector and pass it set the same number of value in its list)
- Add the ability to show the diffrent signal in a same plot dock in differents plot view
- Center the value inside of combobox
- Set 2 plots in a the EEG docks
- Switch the PlotDock class to be inherited instead of having a plot as an attribute
- Change string in txt box in data saver when select other file
- Connect experiment value in the pipeline
- Add a checkable combobox for the filters
- Static graph (HDF5, + connect regions + arrow that follow





(DONE)- remove the mean of the signal => No need filtering the low frequency act the same way

(DONE)- Mettre le temps comme échelle du static graph
(DONE)- Mettre les fichiers dans un repo séparé pour pas que ça soit aussi long a télécharger
(DONE)- Set the second static graphs to occupy all the rows instead of leaving the
    last one blank
- (DONE) Put the spectogram in the direction so that the time is the x direction (?)
- (DONE) Ajouter des axes axes au spectogram
